  Note that I filtered id out here as it is not displayed in the UI.
  Considering the responsibility of the Table component, it should only receive data to be displayed.

  If I had coded this task differently, I could use the id as a key too.
  As the API is always returning the same data in this situation (+ no table filtering), using the index as a key is justifiable here.
